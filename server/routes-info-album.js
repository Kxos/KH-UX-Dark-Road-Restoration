  'Limited Missions rotate among the original campaigns: one monthly Lux campaign and one short campaign each week.',
  '## Medals',
  'A few Spirit parts without original graphics are replaced by a similar part.',
  'The "Medal STR +N" and "Medal DEF +N" effects of Special Attacks and Supernovas are rebuilt from their descriptions, because the original values are lost.',
  '## Shop and draws',
  'Shop draw rates are reconstructed where the original game did not publish them (Medal rarities, guarantees and Skill rates are original): Draw Odds and each banner\'s Details say so.',
  'Bonus items of a draw (Magic Mirror, Gems...) arrive in your Presents.',
  'Free draws cost 1 Jewel. VIP Free Deals are open to everyone, with one free VIP draw per day in total.',
