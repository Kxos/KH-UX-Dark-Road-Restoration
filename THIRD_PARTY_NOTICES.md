## Community sources

Facts, names and values from the following community projects were used as references. Where data
derived from them is in the repository, it is listed here; the original authors keep their rights.

[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licence.
Data in this repository derived from KH Wiki pages (Medal, Special Traits, Spirit parts, story music
notes, enemy pages) is shared under the same licence, with attribution to the KH Wiki contributors:

- `server/pet_parts.tsv`, `server/tables/petParts.json` (Spirit part names, together with the KHUX Wiki);
- `server/make-pet-tables.js` (Special Trait list: names and unlock rates; Spirit Trick values);
- `server/make-story-oltre.js` (music of quests 526-979, read at build time from a local dump);
- the wiki references in `docs/notes/` and `docs/ISSUES.md`.

### KHUX Wiki (khuxwiki.com)

Quest objectives, mission names, Medal values, keyblade levels, Spirit Tricks, area descriptions and many
other facts come from the KHUX Wiki and its contributors. No licence is stated for that wiki; data taken
from it is kept to facts and short names, credited here:

- mission names and conditions: `server/tables/mission.json`, `server/limited_missions.tsv`,
  `server/make-beginner-missions.js`, `server/make-limited-missions.js`;
- area connections and their short wiki descriptions: `recon/tools/world_links.json`;
- guest allies of the story quests: `recon/tools/ally_families.json`;
- keyblade levels: generated locally by `server/make-keyblade-levels.js` from a local wiki dump, never
  versioned;
- Spirit Trick effects and values (texts rewritten in our own words): `server/make-pet-tables.js`,
  `server/tables/petSkill.json`;
- Medal, quest, enemy and skill values read at build time from local dumps (`recon/tools/wiki_dump.py`).

Other wikis consulted for facts: **wikiwiki.jp/khux** (quests 1-750).

### Roboloid & Ultimadei

The [Roboloid KHUχ database](https://roboloid.github.io/khux/) (medal data, multipliers, special attack
conditions) was used as a reference; its files are read locally at build time and are not in this
repository.

### thethiny

[KHUxTools](https://github.com/thethiny/KHUxTools), [KHUx-Server](https://github.com/thethiny/KHUx-Server)
and [KHUx-Recomp](https://github.com/thethiny/KHUx-Recomp) (MIT licence, © 2026 thethiny; their licence
explicitly excludes game data, assets and binaries) documented the formats and the master data this
project builds on. No code from them is copied here; game data from them is read locally and is not in
this repository. [Modding-Database](https://github.com/thethiny/Modding-Database) (GPL-3.0) was consulted
as a reference only; nothing from it is included.

### xlash123

[khux-re-api](https://github.com/xlash123/khux-re-api) documented the 4.3.1 protocol; its findings were
confirmed independently from the client and re-implemented in our own code (`server/khux-codec.js`).

### Other references
