# Resuming the work

This file exists **only to restart**: current state and next step. Problems are in
[docs/ISSUES.md](docs/ISSUES.md), technical knowledge in [docs/notes/](docs/notes/), history in
[docs/journal/](docs/journal/) (the old full HANDOFF is in
[docs/journal/fino-al-2026-10-11.md](docs/journal/fino-al-2026-10-11.md), the states from 14 to 16 October in
[docs/journal/fino-al-2026-10-16.md](docs/journal/fino-al-2026-10-16.md), the state blocks from 17 to 22 October in
[docs/journal/2026-10-22.md](docs/journal/2026-10-22.md)).

## The project

Restoration of **Kingdom Hearts Union χ** (Android WW 4.3.1 client, service shut down in 2021): a
Node server (`server/server.js`) answers the **original**, unmodified client, which runs on
**LDPlayer 9 (Android 9)**, the only bench where the LIAPP protector lets it start
([protector](docs/notes/protector.md)). The resources are the 5.0.1 OBBs + `addnl` from the iOS 4.3.1 IPA +
the packages we build (original JP/2016 stages and rooms, original and rebuilt CocoStudio layouts, textures, medals,
enemy graphics). You can play from the new player to the home screen, story quests **1-979** on the original stages
and rooms (JP 4.3.1 data), Medal List, selling, Level Up, Evolve, Moogle Shop, Shop, Profile, Missions, Avatar Boards,
pet; every deviation from the original is declared in the in-game Notices
([docs/NOTICES.md](docs/NOTICES.md), [web page](https://kxos.github.io/Re-Union-X/notices/)).

## Restarting

Bench state (22-10 evening): **resources 58 installed** (4.22 GiB, 40 parts; after `update-resources.ps1` tap KHUX START (200,1020) and Download (1220,715) by hand; before: 56 (21-10), 49 (20-10: compacted, 3.90 GiB; above 4 GiB tested with 48, I-171 closed)), **master revision: BASE 177** (default of the 4 session scripts; the server sends `BASE*100000 + past deadlines`, [server.md](docs/notes/server.md#orologio)). Fake clock
(twin months 2016-2021), `-RealNow <ISO>` to test a week change: [server.md](docs/notes/server.md#orologio);
full history in [fino-al-2026-10-16.md](docs/journal/fino-al-2026-10-16.md).

```powershell
# emulator (if off)
D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\LDPlayer\LDPlayer9\ldconsole.exe launch --index 0
# server + re-entry of the saved player up to the home screen
.\tools\ldplayer\session\relogin.ps1 -Tag x
# MANDATORY after every emulator start, otherwise the «End of Service» popup
D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\LDPlayer\LDPlayer9\ld.exe -s 0 "sh /mnt/shared/Misc/phaseb-guest.sh 192.168.1.185"
```

- After an emulator restart the client may re-download the latest version (~4.2 GiB, minutes).
- Windows IPv4 DNS on **192.168.1.185** during tests, **automatic** at the end of the session. Guest network broken
  («7 ERROR», `ip route` with no default): `ldconsole reboot --index 0`, `sys.boot_completed`, `phaseb-guest.sh`, relogin.
- Layout tests: `.\tools\ldplayer\session\build-resources.ps1 -Quick` (~40 s, no
  download if the sizes stay within the reserve). **Never `-Quick` if there is a version newer
  than the installed one.** A full version (`-Version N`) is downloaded right away by the
  client: only with the bench stopped, then `update-resources.ps1`.
- After every change to `server/master_data`: raise the revision in the 4 session scripts and
  `relogin.ps1` (twice if the first one crashes). Do not restart only the server with a session open.
- Crashes: `tombstone.ps1`; the deeper crash capture tools and their recipe are private (outside the
  repository). `D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\tmp\repro.ps1 <name> <x> <y>` taps, saves
  requests, logcat and screenshots. Taps only while the game is alive (`bench_lib` refuses taps with the game closed).

## State and next step

(Older state blocks, 17-22 October: [docs/journal/2026-10-22.md](docs/journal/2026-10-22.md).)

- **STATE AS OF 23-10 (END OF DAY) — RESTART FROM HERE.** Master **rev 179**, resources **61** installed (combined objectives animation, I-202 closed). Saves: `provefine` (story 979), `proudall` (all Proud cleared except 979), `proud979` (979 objectives reset), all with `-RealNow 2026-12-09T10:00:00Z`. Verified on the bench 22-10: Proud Mode (I-200 closed: list, popup, condition blocks Special Attacks, levels 210..7000, 801+ all together, 978 cutscene), quest category percentages (I-037 closed), COMPLETE rule (I-201: original = cleared, not objectives; newStageId 0 fix). **Next step:** build resources 62 for I-203 (Optimize button orange via `restyle=` in jp_coco_layouts.txt), install, check the Proud and Story start popups; the bench checks still open: new looks 682/704/840/927/787 and guest allies 350/525/760/905/977 (I-199). Skip button: shown only with Skip Tickets (`stageSkipTicket`); /stage/start does not consume them yet (I-203). Proud panel title «RULE» (JP texture) accepted by the user. Community: Reddit donations in D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\Reddit Donators\ (DONATORE.txt per donor; ReLux Team analysed: notices/banners -> private events catalogue D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\private\events, 38 banners in reference\banners\from_relux); portal gallery with 12 screenshots; name note about the separate project KH ReUnion. Legal: history rewritten twice, GitHub Support ticket open (updated with the second rewrite), fork ZarxielZerg still has the old history (issue #1), local backups tmp\repo_backup_pre_rewrite*.bundle never to be uploaded.
- **STATE AS OF 22-10 EVENING.** Master **rev 179** (Proud Mode rows I-200, guest allies I-199, new looks for 6 families); resources **60** being installed on the bench (download continued after update-resources.ps1 gave up: when the home appears, `relogin.ps1 -Save provefine -RealNow 2026-12-09T10:00:00Z`), then the bench check of Proud 1/3, quests 682/704/840/927/787 (new looks) and 350/525/760/905/977 (allies). **Legal cleanup done (22-10)**: audit (D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\tmp\audit\AUDIT.md), HEAD cleaned, history rewritten with git filter-repo and force-pushed, repo renamed **Re-Union-X** (site https://kxos.github.io/Re-Union-X/), commits with the GitHub noreply address; decryption/protector tools moved to D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\private (outside the repo, found by recon/tools/private_tools.py); GitHub Support ticket sent (cached views + GC); fork ZarxielZerg/KH-UX-Dark-Road-Restoration still has the old history (owner to be asked via an issue). Rules: never publish SE files, download sources, circumvention tools, decompiled code, private communications. A second independent legal check is running.
- **STATE AS OF 22-10 AFTERNOON.** Master **rev 177** (default of the 4 session scripts); resources
  **58 installed** on the bench (22-10 evening; 57 built and superseded); save `provefine` with
  `relogin.ps1 -Save provefine -RealNow 2026-12-09T10:00:00Z` (day 12-09: Login Bonus received, verified by the user;
  use 12-10 for the next one). Bench check done (user, 22-10): Quest 850 Guard Armor Ω and Quest 670 Chill Ripper (original
  look, reconstructed defeat) work; timed quests 595, 619, 633, 643, 655 start correctly (time panel layout). Done in the afternoon: I-194 integration of the original copies found by content
  (`recon/tools/deep_donors.py`, `extra_donors_deep.tsv`; rev 176: 1028 Guard Armor Ω), 1524 Chill Ripper completed
  (dead of the DR twin 5045, user's decision, rev 177): **142 complete families**; 526-979 family rows: 46 own graphics,
  28 Dark Road, 148 base; ~88 families still missing (including the 6 DR medium placeholders). Notices exported by
  `node server/export-notices.js` to `docs/NOTICES.md` and the GitHub Pages page `docs/notices/` (newest first); all
  docs and commit messages in English.

### Open priorities

- **Enemy/NPC graphics of quests 526-979 (I-194)**, priority: source order, status and next steps in
  [ISSUES](docs/ISSUES.md) and [journal 2026-10-22](docs/journal/2026-10-22.md); ~88 families still missing.
- User's open items: I-191 (active banners on the home screen), I-192 (Beginner's Guide WebView), checks against
  the Roboloid data and the wiki's Special Attack page; final web page «Re-Union X» (public project name since 22-10) only as the LAST task.
- Trait deals unlocked by the story 526-979 (e.g. B0259 at quest 725) not yet seen on the bench (I-084,
  [medaglie.md#trait-medal-b](docs/notes/medaglie.md#trait-medal-b)).
- Open Shop items: I-139, I-140, I-141, I-142, I-143, I-145, I-146, I-151 ([shop.md](docs/notes/shop.md)).
- Other pending work (Limited I-118, Blue Fairy and PvP I-126, JP NPCs, intermittent crashes):
  [fino-al-2026-10-16.md](docs/journal/fino-al-2026-10-16.md) and [ISSUES](docs/ISSUES.md).
- Long term: resource balance I-164 and event Boosters I-166 (both ON HOLD).
- Test saves: `provefine` (all 979 quests), `prove`/`prove525`/`provetm`; backups of the real save and the
  test changes made to it: [journal 2026-10-22](docs/journal/2026-10-22.md).

## Work rules (from the user)

- **Commit + push at every verified step**, without asking; `git pull --rebase` before the push
  (other agents commit in parallel). Messages in English (since 22-10 all repository docs are in English too), ending with
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. `git -c safe.directory=*`,
  `git commit -F <file>`; UTF-8 without BOM.
- **Style from the originals**: before building a screen, look for screenshots/videos/data
  of the original, save them in `D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\reference\<screen>\` and
  match them; style check at every step.
- **Parallel agents** for independent work off the bench; the bench stays serial
  (one script at a time). The user watches the bench live: every report of theirs is true,
  verify with screenshots.
- **Dialogues and cutscenes: always press SKIP** when it appears.
- At ~40% of the context: no new tasks, let the running ones finish, commit+push,
  update this file, ask the user for `/compact`.
- Only original code and documentation in the repository: never APKs, assets, Square
  Enix master data or decompiled code (`.gitignore`).

Detailed research notes (addresses, client internals, protector, crash capture) are kept in a private
folder outside the repository (`D:\Progetto_Restauro_KH_UX\private\docs_full\`), never in the public docs.

Setting up a new machine (prerequisites, clone, certificates, Windows network): §3-§4 of
[docs/journal/fino-al-2026-10-11.md](docs/journal/fino-al-2026-10-11.md).

## How to update these files

- **New problem**: a row in [docs/ISSUES.md](docs/ISSUES.md) with the next free ID (never
  reuse an ID) and the technical detail in the right file of `docs/notes/` (with an
  `<a id="...">` anchor to link). When it is closed: status CLOSED, row moved to «Closed», proof =
  commit.
- **Session journal**: `docs/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` of the day (what was tried, outcomes,
  screenshots). The facts that stay true also go into the area notes.
- **HANDOFF.md**: only the state needed to restart (bench, revision, resources, work in progress, next
  step, provisional values in the save). Keep it under ~120 lines.
